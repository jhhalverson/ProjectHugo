This is the default front page the project. The idea
is to use markdown and MathJax to organize a physics project
in a way that is lightweight relative to $\LaTeX$. The
layout below is the sort of organization scheme I like.

## The Project Idea

   The overarching part of this project is to do some interesting physics.

## Components of the Project

The different parts of this project are quarantined in their own files, since that's how projects
typically break down anyways, and each part may lead down interesting tangents. I like to link
to those different parts, though.

I included the example table of contents below so you can see easily how to point links
to the hugo-generated content.

1. [Part One](part1). Click here to see the first part. It's really important for the project.
2. [Part Two](part2). This is the second part. It's the meat, and has lots of calculations.
3. [Part Three](part3). Part three wraps it up.
